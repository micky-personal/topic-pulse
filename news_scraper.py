# --- Part 1: The News Scraper Module ---
# This module is designed to be a self-contained unit for fetching news.
# It uses a Gen AI-powered approach to automatically search for articles
# from specified news sources.

    Scrapes news articles related to a given topic and subtopic from specific
    news APIs using a Gen AI-powered search.

    Args:
        topic (str): The main topic to search for (e.g., "technology").
        subtopic (str): A more specific detail to refine the search (e.g., "AI breakthroughs").
        num_articles (int): The number of articles to attempt to scrape.

    Returns:
