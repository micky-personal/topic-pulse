# --- Part 1: The Social Media Scraper Module ---
# This module is designed to be a self-contained unit for fetching social media posts.
# It uses a Gen AI-powered approach to automatically search for posts
# from social media platforms.

def scrape_social_media(topic: str, subtopic: str, num_posts=5):
    """
    Scrapes social media posts related to a given topic and subtopic using a Gen AI-powered search.

    Args:
        topic (str): The main topic to search for (e.g., "technology").
        subtopic (str): A more specific detail to refine the search (e.g., "AI breakthroughs").
        num_posts (int): The number of posts to attempt to scrape.

    Returns:
        list: A list of dictionaries, where each dictionary represents a social media post.
              The data structure is identical to that of news_scraper.py for easy integration.
              Returns an empty list if no posts could be scraped.
